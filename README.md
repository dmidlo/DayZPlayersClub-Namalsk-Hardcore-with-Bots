They say the island itself wants to kill you.  The other survivors…. need to.

With no factions to rely on, no traders to ease your journey, and the harsh environment of Namalsk itself challenging every step, “Forged Territories” strips DayZ down to its core, delivering an unparalleled hardcore experience. Here, survival isn’t handed to you; it’s earned through strategy, skill, and the will to survive the forsaken island.

An open world event system driven exclusively by player agency set against the desolate and perilous backdrop Namalsk’s storied landscape. In this unyielding world, where the remnants of civilization cling to survival amidst the ruins, your mettle will be tested like never before. Massive plumes of coal-fired smoke rise into the sky, an unavoidable beacon for allies and adversaries alike, signaling the start of a fierce contest for resources, territory, and survival....

In the DayZ Players Club there is often a debate about whether or not base-building or vehicles are appropriate on a map like Namalsk. Namalsk: Forged Territories curates the amazing underground bases mod and the expansive metallurgy forging mod together to create a progression system toward base-building and a base-buillding approach fitting of the Namalsk Landscape.  We've removed the shovel from the floor loot, which is the starting component to construct an underground base for yourself.  We've added three metallurgy forging sites in the Construction site buildings in Vorkuta, Uranium Mine, and the factory site on Tara Island.  You may also note that the snowcapped mountains and runs of Namalsk have several new boulders emerging from them.

After gathering your required materials, you can make your way to one of these sites and forge a shovel head. Be weary, the smelter gives off a massively beautiful miles high plume of rolling black smoke.  Be ready to defend as you forge your survival in the tight CQB quarters of the construction site. Attacker or defender, whoever comes out on top gets their shovel, and the ability to construct a sanctuary.

This not a server pack for exclusive use by the discord community "The DayZ Players Club", but rather an attempt at creating a novel way to experience and survive on Namalsk Island.

There are several recipes added when combining basic items and in scroll wheel actions, certain discoverables and interactables throughout the map.  The loot table has been adjusted.  There are server (hopefully tasteful) Point-of-Interest changes with the two more POIs added.  There are additional challenges and incentives to encourage solo, sqaud, PvE, and PvP play styles through encouraging more player movement throughout the map.

There is no attribution intentionally left not noted, I'm expanding on all the gratitude we have to the DayZ Community and especially the hardworking and creative developers creating dynamic experiences for us for over a decade!

We're currently still in the very early phases of game-design and balancing, both in loot pool, item vehicle spawns rates and locations, .... balancing all the things.  Again our goal is to create a novel and hardcore rendition of the experience Namalsk Survival that stays true to its ethos and lore.  At this point, we are very happy with how we've assembled a gameplay experience and consider this to be our first semi-stable framework.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INSTALL THIS ON YOUR SERVER YET. IT IS NOT READY FOR AUTOMATED DEPLOYEMENT NOR HAVE I ENTIRELY VALIDATED RIGHTS COMPATIBILITY, MOD COMPATIBILITY, NOR ANYTHING ELSE.  that being said, We'd be flattered if you tried out our 'bleeding edge' community server and enjoyed it enough to want to set one up for yourself. Please leave any questions for server setup and config in the comments. 

The DayZ Players Club Discord Community is not exactly a public discord, and not exactly private.  We're just a group of friends who've met in-game in DayZ, other games, and irl.  Feel free to play with us on our DayZ Community Server called "DayZ Players Club Namalsk - Forged Territories".

I, Hunnicuttt, do most of the maintenance on this package. Add a comment below if you have any questions, comments, concerns, or bug reports.

If you're a server owner, I'm happy to provide configs and help with setup. If your a mod maker or map designer, we thank you for your incredible work, though I am constantly expanding documentation, as I have limited time, and I'd rather spend more of it in-game with the boys, please let me know if the package fails to meet any licensing requirements in any way.  We're still working on our preferred method of communications, so please leave comments here on the steam workshop page.
